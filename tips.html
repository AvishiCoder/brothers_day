    <h1>Best tips and tricks</h1>
    <h2>1. Torches create Temporary air pockets underwater</h2>

    <br><br>
Maybe you got too cocky and swam too deep. Maybe you were mining and opened the floodgates. Whatever the case, you're stuck underwater and need air fast. By placing a Torch, the water is temporarily displaced allowing you to get a quick breath in. Make sure you're right up against the torch when you place it for it to work.
<h2>2. Torches break stacks of sand and gravel</h2>

<br><br>
This one is relatively well known. If you need to clear a stack of Sand or Gravel, take out the bottom block and quickly replace it with a Torch. The rest of the stack will collapse onto the torch and break apart.

<h2>3. You can build off of torches</h2>

<br><br>
Aren't torches just the most useful tool around? A little known fact is that you can build off the sides of torches instead of having to place a new block. This could be used as a scaffolding tool and a way to use fewer blocks if you're running low.

<h2>4. Blazes hate snowballs</h2>

<br><br>
Getting a Bow and plenty of arrows takes quite a few resources. If you've been hanging out in a snow biome, chances are you've collected a bunch of snowballs. The Nether is a dangerous place, but luckily these seemingly useless balls of snow can help you out. Toss a few of these at a Blaze to cool him off a little.

<h2>5. In Creative Mode, Middle click gives you the object you're looking at</h2>

<br><br>
Somehow this one isn't as well known as it should be. In Creative Mode, clicking the scroll wheel of your mouse will put whatever you're looking at in your inventory. This even works on leaves, grass, and mobs!

<h2>6. You only need two buckets of water to create an infinite water source</h2>

<br><br>

By creating a small trench of 3 blocks and filling both sides using a Bucket of water, you will create an infinite water source. Only take out water from the middle or you'll accidentally destroy it. This is helpful for making a more desirable infinite water source.

<h2>7. Water makes a good lawn mower</h2>

<br><br>
Are you annoyed by the pesky Grass around your house or simply want to free up a large flat space for building? Use a Bucket of water on the grass. It will spread and take out any grass in its path.
