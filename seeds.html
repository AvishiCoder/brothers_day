   <h1>Some amazing seeds</h1> 
   <h2>Deadly spawn with diamonds</h2>
   Whether you consider this seed good or bad totally depends upon your skillset. It spawns you inside a massive hole, which is directly in the middle of flowing water. If you donâ€™t move, the water will slowly push you into the lava lake at the bottom of this hole. You can choose to go with the flow and find a fossil near lava with 6 diamond ore blocks in it.
